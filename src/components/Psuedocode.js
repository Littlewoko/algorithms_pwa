    <p> 
        The method of representation that you have seen in previous sections is known as 
        pseudo code. There is no standardised syntax for pseudo code, instead the writer 
        uses a mix of human language and programming concepts to create easy to understand 
        steps. This method is mostly used for planning, documentation and explanation in order
        to present a programming concept to others, or to create a fast version of an algorithm
        which can be translated to code later.
